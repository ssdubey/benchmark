Machine configuration:
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz
RAM: 16GB

Following experiments are done on docker container:

output1

badgerdb
fresh PRIVATE ipfs for each run of the input
input varies from 16B to 2MB in power of 2
in most of the input files the extra data is appended over the data of smaller file. This should not matter until block size of 256kb. 
experiments should be performed to verify the effects.
